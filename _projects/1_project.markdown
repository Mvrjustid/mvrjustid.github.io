The popular treatment for chronic pain (CP) is focused on physical rehabilitation organised by physios at clinics. The physio observe the movement behavior of people with CP during the rehabilitation session, and respond with encouragement, feedback and intervention. Here, movement behaviors like guarding, stiffness, hesitation, the use of support, and jerky motion are referred to as **protective behavior**. The figure shown below contains avatar examples transformed from movement data of normal people and people with chronic pain. Could you spot the difference?

    </div>

Unfortunately, the service offered in clinic is only available to the few. On the other hand, applying the movement strategies learned from clinic to daily self-directed managements is difficult. This is particularly due to the reduced self-awareness of the use of protective behavior in a daily scenario, which could worsen the condition except for bringing temporary comfort to the person.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/" target="_blank">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
